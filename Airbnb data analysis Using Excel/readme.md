## Project Goal

Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Microsoft Excel and tell a story using a dashboard built in Excel. Additionally, perform **statistical analysis** to find determinants and associations between different variables.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In this project, we conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Microsoft Excel to understand key patterns and trends in Airbnb bookings across nine major European cities. The dataset includes attributes such as **price, room type, guest satisfaction, location proximity, and attraction indices**.

### EDA Process:

#### Data Cleaning & Preparation:
- Checked for missing values and handled inconsistencies.
- Standardized variable formats and ensured data accuracy.
- Removed duplicate or irrelevant records.

- Summarized categorical variables such as **room type distribution**.


#### Visualization & Insights:
- Used **PivotTables and Charts** to analyze **pricing trends** based on room type and city.
- Created a **heatmap** for **guest satisfaction vs. cleanliness rating**.

- Compared **attraction index** and **restaurant index** across cities.

#### Statistical Analysis:
- Identified **correlations** between price, location, and guest satisfaction.
